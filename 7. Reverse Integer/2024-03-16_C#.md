Attempt 1 - C# - March 16, 2024

# Intuition
- We need a way to deal with '-'. (negative sign)
- We'll need to reverse the int, I think converting to string appears valid.
- We don't need to use a list as 'Array.Reverse()' exists.
- We need to handle 32bit integer overflows.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- I used the above intuition notes to create my solution.
- 'Int32.TryParse' was used to handle overflow.

# Complexity
Time complexity:
$$O(log(n))$$
As each digit of input integer needs iteration.

Space complexity:
$$O(log(n))$$
As each digit of input integer needs to be stored in array.


---


# Further Thoughts
 - Space complexity could be reduced by not relying on an array, apparently there is a better solution without needing conversions or arrays.

I am confident in this solution, it is valid.
However further improvements can be made.

# Code
```
public class Solution {
    public int Reverse(int x) {
        
        bool isNegative = x < 0;
        int a;

        string temp = x.ToString();

        char[] numberList = temp.ToCharArray();

        Array.Reverse(numberList);

        string ret_val = string.Join("", numberList);

        if (isNegative) {
            ret_val = ret_val.Replace("-", "");

            ret_val = "-" + ret_val;
        }

        if (Int32.TryParse(ret_val, out a)) {
            return a;
        } else {
            Console.WriteLine(ret_val);
            return 0;
        }
    }
}
```
