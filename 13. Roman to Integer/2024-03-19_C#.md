Attempt 1 - C# - March 19, 2024

# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
- We need a way to handle special cases.
- We'll need to parse each char of the string.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
- Substring was used to split the string.
- Substring was also used to compare 2 chars at a time for special cases

# Complexity
Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$
As each char of the input string needs iteration.

Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$
As no data is created based on input size, this is constant.

---


# Further Thoughts
 - Space complexity could be reduced by reducing the length of the Dictionary
 - Time complexity is at a good level
 - This solution appears to be able to support longer length numerals (ex if: "IVL" = 125)

I am confident in this solution, it is valid.
However further improvements can be made.

# Code
```
public class Solution {
    public int RomanToInt(string s) {
        int runningTotal = 0;
        
        // searchRange - How many chars in string to grab
        int searchRange;


        Dictionary <string, int> numeralBook = new Dictionary <string,int>();
        numeralBook.Add("I",    1);
        numeralBook.Add("V",    5);
        numeralBook.Add("X",   10);
        numeralBook.Add("L",   50);
        numeralBook.Add("C",  100);
        numeralBook.Add("D",  500);
        numeralBook.Add("M", 1000);
        numeralBook.Add("IV",   4);
        numeralBook.Add("IX",   9);
        numeralBook.Add("XL",  40);
        numeralBook.Add("XC",  90);
        numeralBook.Add("CD", 400);
        numeralBook.Add("CM", 900);

        for (int index = 0; index < s.Length; index++) {
            searchRange = 1;
            if (index + 1 < s.Length) {
                if (numeralBook.ContainsKey(s.Substring(index, 2))) {
                    searchRange = 2;
                } else {
                    searchRange = 1;
                }
            }
                runningTotal += numeralBook[s.Substring(index, searchRange)];

                // adjust the index based on searchRange (expected "-1 + 1 = 0" or "-1 + 2 = 0")
                index += (-1 + searchRange);           
        }

        return runningTotal;

    }
}
